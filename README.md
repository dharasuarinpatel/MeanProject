Report on Project 2 
===================

a.What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
------------------------------------------------
It was a great opportunity to learn serverside (NodeJs) and 
client side (AngularJs) frmeworks in Project 1. And that helped 
in understanding the requirement for Project 2 quickly. As I knew 
mongoDB from another course, it made easy to use and implement mongoDB 
aspects.

b.What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
------------------------------------------------
It was quite difficult to understand how to pass data between controller, 
model and view as needed to pass only one record for each AJAX style call 
using some primary key. Also, it was difficult to understand the reason that
sometime view does not get refreshed as new data arrive and display them together.

c.If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The biggest concern will be of choosing appropriate technologies for the application
base on their requirements,  e.g. which database should be used, which client and 
server side frameworks should be used. The reason behind that is each technology has 
its own advantages and also disadvantages. And that makes it more important to focus 
on choosing technologies to gain best outcome. e.g. is it one-page-application or not?,
it requires continuous connection to the server or not, and it requires constat data 
fetching or updating.
